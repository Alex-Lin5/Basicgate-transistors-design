# Basicgate-transistors-design
### Design basic gates including invertors and NAND gates 
- Analysed with timing transient command tool, including voltage and capacitance variation
- Transistors, power source and ground are connected via nodes
- Observe waveform on ScScope, running simulation on remote server ecs-linux.syr.edu
- `.sp` are source files for HSPICE simulation
